# Welcome to the Teaching Materials Repository!

Hello, everyone!
Welcome to this repository where we share teaching materials on computer science and programming, specifically designed around [MicroStudio](https://microstudio.dev)’s capabilities. If you’d like to contribute, feel free to submit a request, and add your material to help expand our resources.

## Guidelines for Contributions

- **Writing Articles**: Please use [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) for articles. This allows others to view them in a nicely formatted way, with support for attachments, links, and more.
- **Adding Code**: Place any code examples directly next to your article for easy reference.
- **Organization**: Help us keep the repository organized and structured so everyone can easily find what they need.

You have two options to add your materials:

- Add a [Wiki](https://github.com/gostrobrod/MicroStudio-Teaching/wiki) page
- Add files straight to the repo. [Here](https://github.com/gostrobrod/MicroStudio-Teaching/wiki/Adding-materials-straight-to-repo) is a guide how to to that.

Thank you for contributing to our learning community!
